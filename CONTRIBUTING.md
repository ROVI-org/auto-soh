## How to contribute to Moirae

#### **Authorship model**

Due to the limited size of the Moirae team, we adhere very closely to the following authorship model:
- Code written by an **author** cannot be altered by another contributor without explicit approval and review by the original **author**
- In most instances, we prefer contributors to open an issue (Feature Request, Bug Report, etc.), tag the original **author**, and allow them to implement requested changes. If the original **authors** find merit in the request and are not able to address it, they can allow the contributor to make changes after **in-depth discussion.**
- In all issues and PRs, original **authors** must be tagged and serve as required reviewers.
- If a contributor's PR is approved, they are invited to join the set of **authors** for that section of the code.

As of now, the **authors** are: 
- @WardLT: anything related to data (including interface with BatteryDataToolkit), such as model-adjacent class definitions; simulator
- @victorventuri: model definitions and utilities; estimators
 

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ROVI-org/auto-soh/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ROVI-org/auto-soh/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

* Tag all **authors** of the code that is generating the bug. If appropriate, reach out to them through Slack/email/Teams.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. Request review from original **authors**.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/ROVI-org/auto-soh/issues/new) using the appropriate Feature Request template to initiate a discussion.
  * Make sure you tag the original **authors** of the portions of the code the new feature would have to interact with, and, if appropriate, reach out to them through Slack/email/Teams.

* If explicit approval from technical **authors** is given, write the code that implements the feature, submit a PR, and assign the technical **authors** as required reviewers.
  * Your PR must follow the provided template: clearly explain what the new feature does, include at least 95% coverage tests of the new code (without reducing the coverage of other tests), and provide notebook demonstrations of how the new feature is used. 

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Moirae to any member of the team. We are excited to share it with you!

Thanks!
